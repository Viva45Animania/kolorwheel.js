kolorwheel.js
=============

Color palette generator JavaScript library

This small javascript library is designed for developers,
who have no talent and time to create
professional color palettes.
Pick a base color,
build a transformation chain,
and if you haven't choosen too weird parameters,
the result will be satisfactory.
